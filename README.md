# Facial Recognition Project ðŸ§ ðŸ“¸

Welcome to the **Facial Recognition Project** repository!  
This project showcases a simple implementation of **face detection** and **face recognition** using popular Python libraries.

---

## ðŸ›  Project Overview

This project demonstrates:

- **Face Detection**: Identifying faces in images or real-time video.
- **Face Recognition**: Matching detected faces against a known dataset.

It leverages **OpenCV** and **face_recognition** libraries to perform both tasks efficiently.

---

## ðŸ”¥ Technologies Used

- Python 3.10
- OpenCV
- face_recognition (based on dlib)
- Numpy

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/OscarAhumadaG/FacialRecognitionProject.git
cd FacialRecognitionProject
Install dependencies:
```
```
bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
(If there's no requirements.txt, install manually: opencv-python, face_recognition, numpy)
```

Run the scripts:

To recognize faces in an image:
```
bash
Copy
Edit
python recognize_faces_images.py
```

To recognize faces from your webcam (real-time video):
```
bash
Copy
Edit
python recognize_faces_video.py
```

ðŸ–¼ How It Works
Dataset Preparation: Place images of known individuals in the dataset/ folder. Each image filename should correspond to the person's name.

Face Encoding: The scripts encode known faces.

Recognition: The model detects faces in new images or videos and matches them with the known dataset.

ðŸ“ˆ Future Improvements
Improve recognition accuracy with better preprocessing.

Add GUI interface for easier use.

Integrate deep learning models for face detection (e.g., MTCNN).

Expand to multiple camera inputs.
